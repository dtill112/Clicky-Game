•In this repository is a small game that I created using React.js.

•This application is more or less a memory game where the user must select a unique "card" with a character on it. Next, the cards will schuffle and the user will be asked to select another card. 

•The objective is to never select the same card twice. Every time the user selects a card that they have not selected before, they get a point. The users Top Score will be displayed until the page is reloaded. There are a total of 20 cards and so the maximum sciore is 20.

•Using a component based software, React gives the developer the ability to isolate and manipulate individual "sections" of the DOM. For example, each of the character cards are individual components, as is the navbar etc.

•While developing this application, I also used bootstrap, css and most importantly, React.
